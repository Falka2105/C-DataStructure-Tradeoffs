# C Data Structure Trade-offs: Array vs Linked List

`Analyzes algorithmic trade-offs (search vs. insertion complexity) of a fixed-capacity ordered array and a dynamic linked list in C.`

This project implements two generic (`void*`) and sorted data structures from scratch to empirically analyze and demonstrate the fundamental trade-offs of each approach.

The `main.c` executes a stress test that includes:
* Initial data loading from .csv files.
* Insertions at the beginning, middle, and end of the structures.
* Removals from the head and middle of the structures.
* Complete memory cleanup (`malloc`/`free`) to demonstrate zero memory leaks.

## 🔬 Trade-Off Analysis

The goal of this project was to demonstrate the performance and memory differences between an ordered array and a linked list.

| Feature | `OrderedArray` (Sorted Array) | `LinkedList` (Sorted Linked List) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Search** | **O(log n)** - Very Fast | **O(n)** - Slow |
| **Insertion** | **O(n)** - Slow | **O(n)*** - Slow (to find position) |
| **Removal** | **O(n)** - Slow | **O(n)*** - Slow (to find position) |
| **Memory** | **Static** (Single Block) | **Dynamic** (Per-Node) |
| **Key Advantage** | Unbeatable search speed. | No capacity limit; `O(1)` insert/remove *if pointer is already held*. |
| **Key Disadvantage** | Costly `O(n)` insertion/removal (shifting). Fixed capacity. | Very slow `O(n)` linear search. |

*\*While the "re-wiring" for a list insert/remove is `O(1)`, finding the correct position in a **sorted** list still requires an `O(n)` traversal, making the total operation `O(n)`.*
